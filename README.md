# Exchange-Maintenance

Originally posted in the MS Technet Gallery but was lost in the stupid decision to shut everything down and leave it to the original authors to repost them on the new place. We understand the concerns due to intellectual property and other things, but really? There sure were other ways to get by.

This is NOT my work. It is from Vijaya Reddy, whom you can find here: https://www.blogger.com/profile/08822887414786847861
Since he has not posted for a long time and I have the files for my own use, I decided to post them here.
There are, of course, some things that could be done to improve this work.
But I dont want to interfere with another ones work publicly.

Vijaya, if you read this, feel free to contact me if you have any complaints about posting your work.
I will take it down if you decide this way. it is your work after all.

The script itself was posted on the MS Technet Gallery: https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/office/DAG-Maintenance-Health-931b75d8

If you want to tamper with it, execute it and grab the powershell script file from the temp folder to alter it.

I dont know which technique Vijaya used to create the exe file but you can use IExpress or PS2EXE to reach that goal.

There are others, of course, but these two would do the job fully.
